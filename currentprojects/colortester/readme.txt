9/30	Started blocking out html for future add-ons, including Inputs, buttons in html, and most variables in javascript
		This unused code is currently commented out(in html and Javascript).

10/1	running into an issue changing a:hover by manipulating the DOM.  Can target appropriate element
		The error is likely happening because of the hover pseudo-class.

To Do:

Figure out how to start next block (fonts, having issue with this one)

	-FIXED: 9/28	problem with with a for loop and path specificity

Format javascript notes
